#Know That City. 
The idea here is to test you on the quality of your knowledge pertaining to the current city you live in.

#Premiss
- Let's say you just moved half way around the world and don't know where anything is. Well rather than opening google maps on your phone and killing your data bill every month, because let's be honest, it's going to take you a while to learn about your city streets.
- This app was developed to teach and test you on the streets, landmarks, tourist sites, and popular locations like bars, shops, etc.


#That's all for now, we'll keep details coming as we figure our shit out..... lol
